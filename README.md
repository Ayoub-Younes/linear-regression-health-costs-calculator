# Linear Regression Health Costs Calculator

## Project Overview
This project implements a linear regression model to predict health insurance costs based on various factors. The model takes into account numerical features such as age and BMI, as well as categorical features including sex, number of children, smoking status, and region. The objective is to provide an accessible tool for estimating health expenses, leveraging machine learning techniques to enhance predictive accuracy.

## Technologies Used
Python: The primary programming language used for data processing and model implementation.
TensorFlow/Keras: Libraries for building and training the neural network model.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: For numerical computations.
Matplotlib: For data visualization and plotting.
Scikit-Learn: For data preprocessing and model evaluation.
